# My Bank Micro-Frontend Architecture

This document outlines the micro-frontend architecture strategy for the My Bank system, which needs to support multiple user roles (admin, banker, customer) with potentially different frontend applications.

## Architecture Overview

We've chosen a **multi-repository approach** for our micro-frontend architecture to maintain clear separation between different user interfaces while ensuring they can all communicate with the same backend API.

### Benefits of Multi-Repository Approach

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each frontend application has its own repository, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Independent Deployment**: Each frontend can be deployed independently, reducing risk and allowing for different release cycles.
3. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different frontends without stepping on each other's toes.
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Each frontend can potentially use different technologies or versions if needed.
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Avoids the complexity and potential clutter of a monorepo setup.

## Repository Structure

```
my-bank-admin/           # Admin portal (Next.js)
my-bank-banker-portal/   # Banker portal (planned)
my-bank-customer-portal/ # Customer portal (planned)
my-bank-shared-lib/      # Shared components/utilities (optional)
```

## Shared Code Strategy

For code that needs to be shared across frontends, we have two options:

1. **Published NPM Package**: Create a shared library published as an NPM package.
2. **Copy with Governance**: Duplicate essential code with strict governance to ensure consistency.

For the initial phase, we recommend option 2 (copy with governance) to avoid the overhead of package management until the shared code stabilizes.

## Authentication & API Integration

All frontends will:

1. Use the same authentication mechanism (JWT)
2. Integrate with the same backend API
3. Implement role-based access control

## Deployment Strategy

Each frontend will be containerized with Docker, allowing for:

1. Consistent development environments
2. Easy deployment to any environment
3. Scalability and portability

## Frontend-Specific Considerations

### Admin Portal (Current)

- **Primary Users**: System administrators
- **Key Features**: User management, account oversight, system monitoring
- **Technical Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### Banker Portal (Planned)

- **Primary Users**: Bank employees
- **Key Features**: Customer management, account creation, transaction processing
- **Technical Stack**: TBD (recommend consistency with Admin Portal)

### Customer Portal (Planned)

- **Primary Users**: Bank customers
- **Key Features**: Account dashboard, transaction history, fund transfers
- **Technical Stack**: TBD (potentially lighter weight than admin/banker portals)

## Integration Points

All frontends will integrate with the backend API at these key points:

1. **Authentication**: `/api/auth` endpoints
2. **User Management**: `/api/users` and `/api/admin` endpoints
3. **Account Operations**: `/api/accounts` endpoints
4. **Transactions**: `/api/transactions` endpoints

## Future Considerations

1. **Mobile Applications**: Consider React Native for mobile apps to leverage shared logic
2. **API Gateway**: May need to implement an API gateway if backend services grow
3. **Shared Component Library**: Evaluate need for a formal shared component library as UIs mature
